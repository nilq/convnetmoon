# ConvNetMoon

ConvNetMoon is a MoonScript implementation of neural networks, based on ConvNetJS. It currently supports:

- Common **Neural Network modules** (fully connected layers, non-linearities)
- Classification (SVM/softmax) and Regressoin (L2) **cost functions**
- Ability to specify and train **Convolutional Networks**

**[STATUS]** I'm remaking this masterpiece.

The primary reason I'm making this thing is to express my eternal love to the MoonScript language. It is for all the people out there (me) who want to write machine learning software in vanilla MoonScript, from vanilla MoonScript.
