# ConvNetMoon

ConvNetMoon is a MoonScript implementation of neural networks, based on ConvNetJS. It currently supports:

- Common **Neural Network modules** (fully connected layers, non-linearities)
- Classification (SVM/softmax) and Regressoin (L2) **cost functions**
- Ability to specify and train **Convolutional Networks**

**[STATUS]** I'll start doing tests and demos now.
